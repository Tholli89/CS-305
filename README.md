# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that creates individual plans for their clients on savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The issue that they wanted me to address was to secure their custom software with current and effective software security. This entailed examining the custom software and taking steps to eliminate software vulnerabilities and exposures.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I believe I did well implementing and understanding the maven plugin to create a dependency report. This helped to understand the vulnerabilities and exposures in the code so that secure practices could be implemented to protect the program. This is important so that Artemis Financial clients' information was not at risk of being stolen by malicious individuals or organizations. implementing secure code develops a sense of trust with their clients and mitigates the company needing to clean up after breach as well as meeting governmental requirements.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The most challenging aspect of working through the vulnerability assessment was understanding the vulnerabilities and how to secure them. An example is knowing how to sort through false positives. The most beneficial aspect of working through the assessment was understanding the importance of keeping your code up to date and when applicable to update the dependencies to the latest versions.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I approached implementing layers of security through a continuous lifecycle aspect such as going through the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram and using dependency reports at every step. For example, after implementing changes in code and patching vulnerability and exposures in the code it was good practice to run a dependency check again to verify that we did not add any new vulnerabilities or exposures.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
At every stage of development, the code was manually reviewed, and a dependency report was ran to ensure security practices were in place and no new security vulnerabilities or exposures were introduced. The code was also run often to ensure correct functionality.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The most important tool that I employed was the maven plugin that will be very helpful in implementing secure practices in the future.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
From this assignment I would want to showcase that I can examine code, use plugins, and implement corrective action to secure code.
